            <p> Performance employment law legal procedures, as an ongoing communication
                 process between employers and employees, offer a means of facilitating
                  dialogue between employers and employees. They also offer an importan
                  t means of avoiding, or reducing, allegations of bad faith treatment 
                  of employees by employers during the employment relationship and at
                   the point of dismissal. It must be understood, that while performance
                    employment law legal procedures offer a holistic approach to the
                     employment relationship, and strive, through communications,
                      to lead employers away from the more traditional command and 
                      control model towards a facilitation model of leadership, the
                       law has, through legislation and court decisions, provided s
                       ome guidelines which are relatively rigid, and which govern
                        the employment relationship. 
                These laws and court decisions will also govern any performance 
            </p>

                There is many problems in the job that effects the employee for example during 
                searching of the job they met discrimination for many sides like gender and they
                 don’t like to employee the women due to the maternity leaves. And the employer
                  make unfair during employment and they don’t assess the knowledge of the
                   people who seek the job, because it takes time to find a suitable employee
                    for a specific job. Jobs usually require specific skills, and only some
                     job seekers may have these skills. Moreover, employers may need formal
                      or informal tests to assess whether an applicant has the required skills.
                       It takes time to attract applicants and to decide whether they are
                        suitable. An employer can take measures to reduce this uncertainty.
                         Most jobs have periods of notice that allow the employer to start
                          searching and hiring before the present employee has left.
                           There are a variety of ethical decisions and problems which
                            organizations encounter when selecting employees into
                             organizations.

                This case addressed whether a state law limiting how many hours 
                per week baker could legally work was constitutional. (James Wilson, 2013)
                The Lochner Court based its opinion on the idea that the United State
                s Constitution ensured one’s freedom of contract, which essentially
                 means that an employee and employer are free to decide work conditions
                 , even if those conditions mean working seven days a week,

                This study on recruiters has focused on the impact of various 
                recruiter characteristics (e.g., demographics, behaviours) on
